# QLEAR & Ambiarc Integration

[Hosted Demo Link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/gk-web-demo/ambiarc/aqd/app/index.html)

This project features a map of [The Pavillion](https://onemuseumplace.cn/one-museum-place/the-pavilion/), an upcoming retail space in Shanghai, China. Using the [QLEAR API](https://qlear.io), real-time indoor air quality data is displayed on the map. You can view the air quality of the entire building, each floor, or specific units.

To run the project locally, add your QLEAR API key to 'config.js'.
